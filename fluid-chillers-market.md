<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluid chillers are devices used to remove heat from a liquid through a vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycle. There are two main types of fluid chillers in the market: water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled chillers use water as a coolant to dissipate heat from the system, making them more efficient and suitable for high-capacity applications. On the other hand, air-cooled chillers use ambient air to cool the refrigerant, making them easier to install and maintain, but less energy-efficient than water-cooled chillers.</p></p>
