<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IoT RFID Labels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Labels</li><li>Active Labels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive IoT RFID labels do not have their power source and rely on an external RFID reader to power them. They are cost-effective and widely used for tracking and inventory management. Active IoT RFID labels, on the other hand, have their power source and can transmit data over longer distances. They are used for real-time monitoring of assets and have a higher upfront cost but offer more advanced functionality. Both passive and active labels play a crucial role in the IoT RFID market, catering to different needs and preferences.</p></p>
