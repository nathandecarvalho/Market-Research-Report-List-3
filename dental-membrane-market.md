<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resorbable Dental Membrane</li><li>Non-resorbable Dental Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental membranes are used in dental surgeries for guided bone regeneration. Resorbable dental membranes are designed to be absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove them. Non-resorbable dental membranes do not break down and must be removed manually. Both types of membranes serve the same purpose of protecting the bone graft and promoting tissue regeneration, but their differing properties offer options for clinicians based on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
