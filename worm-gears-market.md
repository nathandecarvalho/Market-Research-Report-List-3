<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Worm Gears Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Enveloping Worm Gears</li><li>Double-Enveloping Worm Gears</li><li>Non-Enveloping Worm Gears</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Worm gears come in three main types: single-enveloping, double-enveloping, and non-enveloping. Single-enveloping worm gears have a one-sided contact between the worm and the gear, providing higher efficiency but potentially lower load capacity. Double-enveloping worm gears have teeth on both sides of the worm, offering better load distribution and higher precision. Non-enveloping worm gears have a curved tooth profile, allowing for smoother operation but limited load capacity. Each type has its own advantages and applications in various industries.</p></p>
