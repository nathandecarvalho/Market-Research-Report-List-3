<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrided Vanadium Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum Production Process</li><li>Non-vacuum Production Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrided Vanadium market can be categorized into two types based on the production process - Vacuum Production Process and Non-vacuum Production Process. In the Vacuum Production Process, vanadium is processed in a high vacuum environment to produce high-quality nitrided vanadium with superior properties. On the other hand, in the Non-vacuum Production Process, vanadium is treated at atmospheric pressure, which can result in slightly lower quality nitrided vanadium compared to the vacuum process. Both types of processes cater to different market demands and applications.</p></p>
