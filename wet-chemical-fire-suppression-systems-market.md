<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wet Chemical Fire Suppression Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Release System</li><li>Indirect Release System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wet chemical fire suppression systems are categorized into Direct Release System and Indirect Release System. The Direct Release System discharges the agent directly onto the fire source to suppress it immediately. On the other hand, the Indirect Release System releases the agent into the protected area to lower the oxygen levels and prevent fire from spreading. Both types of systems utilize a liquid agent that reacts with the fire to extinguish it effectively and efficiently.</p></p>
