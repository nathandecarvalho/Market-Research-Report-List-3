<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casing Scraper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Rotational</li><li>Rotational</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Casing scrapers are used in the oil and gas industry to clean mud, rust, scale, and cement from casing walls. There are two main types of casing scrapers on the market: non-rotational and rotational. </p><p>Non-rotational scrapers are simple tools that are run in the casing and pulled out manually, effectively scraping away debris. Rotational scrapers, on the other hand, are equipped with rotating blades that can effectively clean the casing walls by rotating while being run downhole. Both types of scrapers serve the same purpose of maintaining clean casing walls for optimal well performance.</p></p>
