<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Traction Elevators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Geared Traction Elevators</li><li>Gearless Traction Elevators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Traction elevators are commonly divided into two types: geared and gearless. Geared traction elevators use a gearbox to control the movement of the cab, making them suitable for buildings with lower height requirements. On the other hand, gearless traction elevators operate without a gearbox, offering smoother and more energy-efficient performance, ideal for tall buildings or high-rise structures. Both types of traction elevators play a crucial role in the vertical transportation system, meeting different needs and demands in the market.</p></p>
