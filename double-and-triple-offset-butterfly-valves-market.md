<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double and Triple Offset Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Offset Butterfly Valves</li><li>Triple Offset Butterfly Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double offset butterfly valves have two offset points, one in the center and one at the edge of the disc, which reduces friction and wear when the valve is in motion. Triple offset butterfly valves have an additional offset that creates a cam-like action to further reduce friction and provide a tighter seal. The triple offset design also allows for higher pressure and temperature applications compared to double offset butterfly valves. Both types are popular choices for applications requiring reliable, leak-proof shutoff.</p></p>
