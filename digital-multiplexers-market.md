<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Multiplexers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synchronous TDM</li><li>Anynchronous TDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital multiplexers are devices used to combine multiple data streams into one signal for transmission over a single communication channel. Synchronous TDM involves dividing the transmission channel into time slots, where each data stream is assigned a specific time slot for transmission. Asynchronous TDM, on the other hand, does not rely on a fixed time slot allocation. Instead, data streams are transmitted based on demand, allowing for more flexibility in data transfer. Both types of multiplexers play a crucial role in optimizing communication networks and improving efficiency in data transmission.</p></p>
