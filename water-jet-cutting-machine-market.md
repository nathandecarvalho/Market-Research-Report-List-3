<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Jet Cutting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized Water</li><li>Abrasive Mixture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressurized Water and Abrasive Mixture are two types of water jet cutting machines used in industrial applications. Pressurized Water cutting uses only water at high pressure to cut through soft materials like rubber and foam. On the other hand, Abrasive Mixture cutting involves mixing water with abrasive particles such as garnet to cut through hard materials like metal and stone. Both types offer precise and efficient cutting capabilities, but Abrasive Mixture is preferred for tougher materials due to its added cutting power.</p></p>
