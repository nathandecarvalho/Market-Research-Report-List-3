<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coatings</li><li>Hydrophobic Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning glass market includes two main types of coatings: hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Hydrophilic coatings attract water molecules, which help to break down and wash away dirt and grime from the glass surface. On the other hand, hydrophobic coatings repel water molecules, causing them to form beads that roll off the glass, carrying dirt particles with them. Both types of coatings offer varying levels of cleaning efficiency and durability, catering to different consumer preferences and needs.</p></p>
