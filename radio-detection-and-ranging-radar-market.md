<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulsed Radar</li><li>Continuous Wave (CW) Radar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RADAR, or Radio Detection and Ranging, is a technology used for detecting and tracking objects. There are two main types of RADAR markets: Pulsed Radar and Continuous Wave (CW) Radar. Pulsed RADAR emits short bursts of radio waves and waits for the reflection to return before sending another burst. CW RADAR continuously emits radio waves and measures the frequency change caused by moving objects. Pulsed RADAR is used for long-range detection, while CW RADAR is used for shorter range applications such as speed guns and motion sensors.</p></p>
