<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Speed CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS</li><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Speed CMOS Image Sensor market consists of two main types: Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS sensors and Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensors. </p><p>Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS sensors have the light-sensitive pixel wells located on the front side of the sensor, resulting in some light being lost due to absorption and reflection within the sensor layers. </p><p>In contrast, Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensors have the sensor layers flipped, allowing light to directly reach the pixels from the backside, leading to improved light sensitivity and image quality.</p></p>
