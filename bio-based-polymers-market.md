<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-based Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bio-Degradable</li><li>Non-Degradable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio-based polymers can be classified into two main categories: bio-degradable and non-degradable. Bio-degradable polymers are derived from renewable resources and can be broken down by natural processes into simpler compounds. They are environmentally friendly and reduce the accumulation of waste in landfills. Non-degradable bio-based polymers, on the other hand, are not easily broken down and may persist in the environment for longer periods. Both types offer sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics, catering to the growing demand for eco-friendly materials.</p></p>
